backing at higher odds is more favourable to the bettor
laying at lower odds is more favourable to the bettor

therefore, based on OUR MODELS p(p1 win) estimate, we calculate two things:
0/ the user specifies the EV target (%)
1/ calculate the MINIMUM BACK odds ...
2/ calculate the MAXIMUM LAY odds ...
... for our EV target to be satistified

Note, that BACKING P1 == LAYING P2, and, LAYING P1 == BACKING P2
Therefore in some cases, it is favourable to take the other side (which our model tells us)


We then scan the odds, and extract the games for which satisfy our odds threshold
